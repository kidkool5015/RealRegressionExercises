Linear Regression Plotter
Overview
Linear Regression Plotter is a C# application designed to take input data, visualize it through plots, and calculate a linear regression model to provide insights into the relationship between the variables. The app leverages the power of the ScottPlot library for high-quality plotting and .NET WPF for an intuitive user interface.

Features
Data Input: Import data manually or through a file (e.g., CSV format).
Data Visualization: Plot the data points on a 2D graph for easy interpretation.
Linear Regression Model: Calculate and display the regression line, including key metrics like slope, intercept, and R² value.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive controls for data input, plotting, and analysis.
Customization: For better presentation, adjust plot styles, colors, and axis labels.
Prerequisites
.NET Framework 6.0+
ScottPlot Library (Install via NuGet)
Basic understanding of linear regression and C# development.
Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linear-regression-plotter.git 

Open the project in Visual Studio.
Install dependencies via NuGet Package Manager:
Search for and install ScottPlot.
Build the project to ensure all dependencies are properly configured.
Usage
Run the application.
Input your data manually in the text fields or upload a CSV file.
Ensure the data format is consistent: two columns representing X and Y values.
Click on the Plot button to visualize your data.
Click Calculate Regression to display the linear regression line and key metrics.
Save the plot as an image if needed.

Example

Input data:
X: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  
Y: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10  
The application will:
Plot the data points.

Calculate the regression line with the equation:
Y = 2X + 0
Display R² = 1.0. (Coming Soon)
